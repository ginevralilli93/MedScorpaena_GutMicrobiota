# MedScorpaena_GutMicrobiota
This repository included all the R Scripts created to perform the statistical analyses described in the study "Geographic origin and host’s phylogeny are predictors of the gut mucosal microbiota diversity and composition in Mediterranean scorpionfishes (Scorpaena spp.)" by Lilli et al.,. 
The scripts are divided in:
"Diversity analyses” - alpha and beta diversity analyses performed on the Species and Extended dataset to answer the questions: 1) Does host's phylogenetic relations influence the diversity and composition of the gut mucosal microbiota of Mediterranean scorpionfishes? 2) Is it possible to observe phylosymbiosis among the species of scorpionfishes investigated? 3) Does the gut mucosal microbiota of Mediterranean scorpionfishes vary spatially across the Mediterranean sea? 
“core microbiota” – the core microbiota of Mediterranean scorpionfishes investigated both locally (Bonifacio, Corsica) and across a broader geographical range (three locations along the French Meditarranean coast and one Greek location)

For any question or doubt about the scripts, please contact Ginevra Lilli (ginevralilli93@gmail.com)
